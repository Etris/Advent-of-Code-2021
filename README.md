# Advent of Code: Edition 2021

Welcome at AoC 2021. This is my fourth approach to Advent of Code, 
previous ones were not so spectacular - take a look into this numbers:

|  Year |  Number of stars |
|---|---|
|  2017 |  6 |
|  2018 |  3 |
|  2019 |  9 |
|  2020 |  18|

Currently, number of stars for this year is... __22__! So I've just
made the same score as in the previous year.
